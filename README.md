# Heart Failure Analysis Repository

This repository contains an analysis of the Heart Failure Dataset using Jupyter Notebook, along with related files such as a PowerPoint presentation and the dataset itself.

## Files Included

1. **Heart_failure.csv**: This CSV file contains the Heart Failure Dataset collected from patients during their follow-up period. It consists of 13 clinical features and a target variable indicating whether the patient deceased during the follow-up period.

2. **Heart_Failure_Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for the analysis of the Heart Failure Dataset. It includes sections for Automated EDA, Descriptive Analysis, Diagnosis Analysis, Predictive Analysis, Prescriptive Analysis, and Confusion Matrix evaluation.

3. **Heart_Failure_Analysis_Presentation.ppt**: This PowerPoint presentation summarizes the analysis conducted on the Heart Failure Dataset. It includes slides covering the problem statement, solution approach, EDA, analysis results, and conclusions.

## Automated EDA
- The notebook utilizes the AutoViz library for automated exploratory data analysis (EDA). It provides visualizations and summaries of key statistics to understand the dataset.

## Descriptive Analysis
- This section explores the distribution of clinical features and the target variable. Descriptive statistics are calculated to summarize the dataset.

## Diagnosis Analysis
- Correlation analysis is performed to identify relationships between clinical features and the target variable. Feature importance is also evaluated to understand the significant predictors of heart failure outcomes.

## Predictive Analysis
- Classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Naive Bayes are employed for heart failure prediction. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to assess model performance.

## Prescriptive Analysis
- Recommendations are provided based on predictive insights to optimize patient management and treatment strategies. Ethical considerations are also discussed in implementing prescriptive actions.

## Confusion Matrix
- The confusion matrix is utilized to evaluate the classification models' performance. Additional metrics such as specificity and sensitivity are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting heart failure outcomes.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- AutoViz

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Heart_Failure_Analysis.ipynb` to explore the analysis.
3. Review the PowerPoint presentation for a summary of the analysis findings.
